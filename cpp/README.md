# C/C++ Library

## Compile and test

This library can be built using CMake. A recommended way of building it is:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will generate a static-linked library `libpheval.a`, as well as
a unit test binary `unit_tests`.

Run the `unit_tests` to perform the unit tests:

```
./unit_tests
```

## Use the library

After building the library `libpheval.a`, you can add the `./include`
directory to your includes path, and link the library to your source
code. In addition, at least C++11 standard is required.

For example:

```bash
g++ -I include/ -std=c++11 libpheval.a your_source_code.cc -o your_binary
```

## Examples

In this example we use a scenario in the game Texas Holdem:

Community cards: 9c 4c 4s 9d 4h (both players share these cards)

Player 1: Qc 6c

Player 2: 2c 9h

Both players have full houses. But player 1 only has a four full house over
nine, while player 2 has nine full house over four, which is stronger than
player 1.

The following two sections will show us how this example hands are evaluated
using PHEvaluator. All the code and compiling can be found in the
[examples](examples) directory.

### Example Code in C++

We can construct a Card by providing a two character string, like this:

```C++
phevaluator::Card a = phevaluator::Card("Qc");
```

Then the method `EvaluateCards` will take parameters from 5 to 9 Cards and
return a Rank type. Sometimes, you can provide the strings directly to the
method and let the Cards be constructed implicitly, to make your code
cleaner.

```C++
phevaluator::Rank rank1 =
  phevaluator::EvaluateCards("9c", "4c", "4s", "9d", "4h", "Qc", "6c");

phevaluator::Rank rank2 =
  phevaluator::EvaluateCards("9c", "4c", "4s", "9d", "4h", "2c", "9c");
```

Now that we have the `Rank`s from both players' hands. What information can
we get from them?

First, we can do comparison on these `Rank`s. The `Rank` from a stronger
hand is greater than the `Rank` from a weaker hand.

```C++
assert(rank1 < rank2); // rank2 is stronger
```

We can also get its rank in all 7562 possible hands. This ranking is
identical to the return value of the Cactus Kev's evaluator:
the best rank has value 1, which is a Royal Straight Flush, while the
worst rank is 7462.

```C++
int value1 = rank1.value(); // 292
int value2 = rank2.value(); // 236
```

We can also tell the ranking category of the `Rank`: either using the method
`category` which returns an enumerator, or the method `describeCategory`
which returns a string. In this example, both players are holding full houses.

```C++
assert(rank1.category() == FULL_HOUSE);
assert(rank1.describeCategory() == "Full House");

assert(rank2.category() == FULL_HOUSE);
assert(rank2.describeCategory() == "Full House");
```

Apart from the ranking category, we can use the `describeSampleHand` method to
see the five cards in this `Rank`.

Let's see a sample hand from the `rank2`:

```C++
assert(rank2.describeSampleHand() == "99944");
```

As we can see, the best 5-card hand from player 2 is 9-9-9-4-4. Suit
information is missing from this method, because usually they don't matter,
unless all the five cards have the same suit. So we have another method that
tells us whether the sample hand is a flush. In this example, it is not.

```C++
assert(!rank2.isFlush());
```

### Example Code in C

In the C version, the evaluation would be tricker, since we have to convert
the card to an integer by ourselves.

The formula is `rank * 4 + suit`.

We use 0 for the clubs, 1 for the diamonds, 2 for the hearts, and 3 for the
spades.

And the rank values are:

deuce = 0, trey = 1, four = 2, five = 3, six = 4, seven = 5, eight = 6,
nine = 7, ten = 8, jack = 9, queen = 10, king = 11, ace = 12.

The mapping of a Card and its integer value can be found in [Card Id](#cardid).

```C
// Community cards
int a = 7 * 4 + 0; // 9c
int b = 2 * 4 + 0; // 4c
int c = 2 * 4 + 3; // 4s
int d = 7 * 4 + 1; // 9d
int e = 2 * 4 + 2; // 4h

// Player 1
int f = 10 * 4 + 0; // Qc
int g = 4 * 4 + 0; // 6c

// Player 2
int h = 0 * 4 + 0; // 2c
int i = 7 * 4 + 2; // 9h
```

After constructing all the Cards, we will use `evaluate_7cards` to get a
rank value. A rank value indicates its rank in the 7462 ranking table. The
best rank is 1, which is a Royal Straight Flush, and the worst rank is 7462.

```C
int rank1 = evaluate_7cards(a, b, c, d, e, f, g); // 292
int rank2 = evaluate_7cards(a, b, c, d, e, h, i); // 236
```

If we compare these two rank value, the rank with a smaller value is
stronger.

```C
assert(rank1 > rank2); // rank2 is stronger
```

Similar to the C++ interfaces, we can see the rank category:

```C
enum rank_category category = get_rank_category(rank1);
assert(category == FULL_HOUSE);

const char * categoryDesc = describe_rank_category(category); // "Full House"
```

Or get the sample hand from the rank:

```C
describe_sample_hand(rank2); // 99944
```

We can see the 5 best cards from player 2 are 9 9 9 4 4.

Although suit information is missing here, indeed we only care about whether
all five cards are in the same suit or not. We can check it using the
`is_flush` method:

```C
is_flush(rank2); // false
```

<a name="cardid"></a>
## Card Id

We can use an integer to represent a card. The two least significant bits
represent the 4 suits, ranged from 0-3. The rest of it represent the 13
ranks, ranged from 0-12.

More specifically, the ranks are:

deuce = 0, trey = 1, four = 2, five = 3, six = 4, seven = 5, eight = 6,
nine = 7, ten = 8, jack = 9, queen = 10, king = 11, ace = 12.

And the suits are:
club = 0, diamond = 1, heart = 2, spade = 3

So that you can use `rank * 4 + suit` to get the card ID.
 
The complete card Id mapping can be found below. The rows are the ranks
from 2 to Ace, and the columns are the suits: club, diamond, heart and spade.

|   | C | D | H | S |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11|
| 5 | 12| 13| 14| 15|
| 6 | 16| 17| 18| 19|
| 7 | 20| 21| 22| 23|
| 8 | 24| 25| 26| 27|
| 9 | 28| 29| 30| 31|
| T | 32| 33| 34| 35|
| J | 36| 37| 38| 39|
